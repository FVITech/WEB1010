// Build a trainCapacity variable and set it to 40. Then construct a string
// called occupancy in the following format:
//
//    "4 passengers present. with 36 seats remaining."
//
// In the console, use numPassengers to find the number of passengers
// on the bus, and use (trainCapacity - numPassengers) to find the number
// of seats remaining. Then enter occupancy.
















// Answer:
var trainCapacity = 40
var occupancy = numPassengers + " passengers present, with " + (trainCapacity - numPassengers) + " seats remaining."
occupancy

// Output:
"4 passengers present, with 36 seats remaining."
