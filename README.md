### Summary

* Day 1: First, get students setup with all their accounts, such as portal.office.com and canvas.instructure.com. Then, our goals are to get students familiar with the request-response model, the most common html elements and attributes, and the conceptual basis of the relationship between html, css, js. Use this [Powerpoint Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10vDVvKG7lW_quJ2O5c1nmHttuXlDnOIjeES1xMiaxTI/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_00) while you demonstrate how to use the browser's developer tools and walk students through creating their own html page from scratch. On this day, students also install git and get the crash course of the main commands needed to work on their own.

* Day 2: Our goal is to get students to understand external file linking and the very basics of CSS improving the html page from Day 1 to demonstrate concepts. We define CSS selectors, classes, and rules. We cover the syntax to style by element, style by id, and style by class. We also cover the CSS box model (margin/border/padding), the more basic display styles (block, inline and inline-block), the nature of colors (what rgba is and what it stands for, and hex notation), using a color picker, and the grid of web design. We also give a brief survey of the most important css rules: font rules, color, background color, background images, margin, padding, border, display styles and ask students to use them in their html pages.[The 30 Most Important CSS Selectors](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048)

* Day 3: Recap the grid of web design and html forms. Then have students add a new two-column responsive section to their pages containing some placeholder text on one column and a contact form on the other. Finally explain forms posting (the built-in html mechanism involving input and button with type submit). Tie form posting with the request-response model and explain how the details of the request are specified by the form action and method, and the data being submitted is specified by the *name* of each form input. The form should post to [http://fvi-grad.com:4004/email](http://fvi-grad.com:4004/email) so they can have a working email form on their site.

* Day 4: Get students setup with the fvi-grad digital ocean accounts and push their html-page live. Then, guide the students in completing the [css-practice](./classwork/css-practice) exercises. For the rest of the course, students should publish every project to their digital ocean and submit both the GitHub repo URL and the live URL (served by digital ocean) on canvas.instructure.com.

* Day 5: Start with [Test 1](./test1). Then guide the students through completing the JS road trip 1 exercises.

* Day 6: Guide the students through completing the JS road trip 2 exercises.

* Day 7: Finish the JS road trip 2 exericses. Students will also complete, with instructor's guidance, the Night and Day Project, and Music Boxes Project.

* Day 8: [Test 2](./test2). If students finish early, they can continue working on the Night and Day and Music Boxes projects.

* Day 9: We introduce AJAX programming and instructor leads students in doing the quote of the day assignment. We then move on to the treehouse lightbox video. After the break, we do the mobile drop down menu, and switch our form from day 3 to post with ajax.

* Day 10: Simple drawing app with jquery. Freecodecamp weather app. For the FCC weather app, offer treehouse-like-guidance and let students attempt on their own.

* Day 11: [Final exam preparation](./final-prep) (guided).

* Day 12: [Final exam](./final-exam).
