2. Extra Credit: Complete the exercises from http://fvi-grad.com

#Summary
* Day 1: First, get students setup with all their accounts, such as portal.office.com and canvas.instructure.com. Then, our goals are to get students familiar with the request-response model, most common html elements and attributes, and the conceptual basis of the relationship between html, css, js. Students will learn the definition of html elemnts and attributes by working with a template. On this day, students also install git and get the crash course of the main commands needed to work on their own.

  * [Template](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/carousel/)

* Day 2: Goal is to get students to understand external file linking and the very basics of CSS. We define CSS selectors, classes, and rules. We cover the syntax to style by element, style by id, and style by class. We also cover the CSS box model (margin/border/padding), the more basic display styles (block, inline and inline-block), the nature of colors (what rgba is and what it stands for, and hex notation), using a color picker, and the grid of web design. We also give a brief survey of the most important css rules: font rules, color, background color, background images, margin, padding, border, display styles. Then we ask students to use their newfound css knowledge to apply bootstrap styles to their template and create a new stylesheet and apply custom styles.

* Day 3: Recap the grid of web design and html forms. Then have students add a new two-column responsive section to their pages containing some placeholder text on one column and a contact form on the other. Finally explain forms posting (the built-in html mechanism involving input and button with type submit). Tie form posting with the request-response model and explain how the details of the request are specified by the form action and method, and the data being submitted is specified by the *name* of each form input. The form should post to fvi-grad.com:4004/email so they can have a working email form on their site.

* Day 4: So far we have covered only the three most essential css selectors. On this day we talk about more selectors, namely numbers 1-13, 18, 19, and 20 from [this list](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048) Then we proceed to Test 1. It will involve adding a 3-column responsive section to a website that's given to them. [This template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/) could be an example


* Day 5: JS road trip 1 and as many exercises as possible

* Day 6: JS road trip 2 and as many exercises as possible

* Day 7: Javascript Objects, object access syntax, creating objects, traversing object properties. Students will also complete, with instructor's guidance, the Night and Day Project, and Music Boxes Project.

* Day 8: Real easy javascript exam. Just creating a button that fires an alert.

* Day 9: We introduce AJAX programming and instructor leads students in doing the quote of the day assignment. We then move on to the treehouse lightbox video. After the break, we do the mobile drop down menu, and switch our form from day 3 to post with ajax.

* Day 10: Simple drawing app with jquery. Freecodecamp weather app. For the FCC weather app, offer treehouse-like-guidance and let students attempt on their own.

* Day 11: Final exam preparation (guided), and jquery memory game.

* Day 12: final exam
